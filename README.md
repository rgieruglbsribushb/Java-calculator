## how to use the **Java Calculator**
using the java calculator is very easy -- it uses something similar to 
[**reverse polish notation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation), but instead of putting both operands first then the operation, the operation is before the two operands.

1. put the operation (+, -, *, or /)
2. put the first operand (any integer or decimal, no fractions)
3. put the second operand (same rules as first operand)
4. *note - in subtraction and division, the first number would be the first part of the equation ([4] - 6, [8] / 2) and the second number is the second part (4 - [6], 8 / [2])
