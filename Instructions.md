## how to use the **Java Calculators**
Operating the java calculators is very easy -- it uses something similar to 
[**reverse polish notation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation), but instead of putting both operands first then the operation, the operation is entered before the two operands.

1. put the operation (+, -, *, or /)
2. put the first operand (any integer or decimal, no fractions)
3. put the second operand (same rules as first operand)
